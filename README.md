This is an extensive review of the model Polynomial Affine Gravity. I am only using this repository to save the solutions for the different cosmological scenarios, which I am currently thinking:
1. Field equations in the torsion-free limit.
2. Field equations with non-vanishing torsion effects.
3. Field equations coupled with a scalar field in the torsion-less limit.
4. Field equations coupled with a scalar field and non vanishing torsion fields.

The pdf manuscript is on overleaf.
